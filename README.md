This tool calculates your Osu! area by converting your monitor's current resolution into your tablet's active field in millimeters. Tracking and visualizes cursor movements on a graphics tablet, measuring the area you aim at, providing dimensions and positions. This was inspired in the oldschool "draw in a paper while see a replay" method, but i modernized it(i dont know how no one did that before LOL)
