If you're unfamiliar with GitHub, here’s a direct download link:  [OsuAreaCalculator.exe](https://github.com/KaikeGold/OsuAreaCalculator/releases/download/OsuAreaCalculatorHotfix/OsuAreaCalculator.exe)

AutoHotkey v1.1.x is required to hide and show your cursor.
[Download it here](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-install.exe)

This tool calculates your Osu! area by converting your monitor's current resolution into your tablet's active field in millimeters. Tracking and visualizes cursor movements on a graphics tablet, measuring the area you aim at, providing dimensions and positions. This was inspired in the oldschool "draw in a paper while see a replay" method, but i modernized it(i dont know how no one did that before LOL)
